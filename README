# Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview:
This project encompasses the extraction and cleansing of one month's worth of yellow taxi trip data. The data is cleaned, filtering out records with `passenger_count <= 0`, and then seamlessly loaded into a PostgreSQL database. Subsequently, the data is aggregated to unveil insights into the total amount per day.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Begin by cloning this repository onto your local machine.
2. Proceed to install the necessary libraries via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Update the `config.yaml` file with your PostgreSQL database connection details.
4. Ensure that the specified database in the configuration file (`ota`) is created if it doesn't exist already.

## Execution Instructions:
1. Execute the Python script (`main.py`) to commence the data processing pipeline.
2. Navigate to the `output` directory to locate the generated visualization(s), and simultaneously check the database for the meticulously loaded data.

## Discussion:
During the data loading phase into the PostgreSQL database, a significant challenge arose, promptly addressed through the implementation of a chunking methodology within the Python script. This strategic approach not only ensured efficient processing but also mitigated potential memory errors, enhancing the overall robustness of the pipeline.

## Outputs:
The visualization below portrays the culmination of aggregated insights, illustrating the Total Amount Per Day:
